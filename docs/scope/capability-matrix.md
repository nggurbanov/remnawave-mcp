This matrix is the published capability-level support boundary for the current repository state. It is intentionally aligned to the single-tool `remnawave_api` contract, the runtime discovery surface, and the registry-backed scope map.

Do not read this matrix as endpoint coverage or as a claim that all OpenAPI paths are supported. The current runtime publishes 143 supported operations across 19 domains.

## Capability classes

| Capability class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `supported` | Runnable and published as part of the current operator support promise. |
| `sensitive-read` | Supported read capability with explicit redaction/reveal governance because the output can expose secrets, keys, or admin-sensitive state. |
| `dangerous-write` | Supported high-impact writes that require preview/apply confirmation through the shared tier3 safety gate. |
| `deferred` | Intentionally out of runnable scope until stronger evidence or safer policy exists. |
| `dropped` | Intentionally not carried into the shipped surface. |

See the [danger classes and side-effects reference](../safety/danger-classes-and-side-effects.md) for the complete risk tier definitions, confirmation gating model, and dangerous operations list.

## Version and precedence notes that affect support claims

- Global runtime gate: this repo supports Remnawave 3.3.2 and 3.4.4; unknown or unsupported versions fail before discovery is advertised. This matrix describes the 3.3.2 registry; see the README for the 3.4.4 OpenAPI route.
- Published support is capability-based and registry-backed, not path-count-based.
- Discovery is supported-only; deferred and excluded operations are absent from runtime discovery.

## Migration note: single-tool contract only

This matrix describes capabilities exposed exclusively through the single `remnawave_api` tool. Legacy multi-tool MCP designs (where each operation was a separate discoverable tool) are not supported.

**Key implications:**

- Discovery returns one tool: `remnawave_api`
- Operations are accessed via `domain` + `operation` + `payload`, not individual tool names
- No compatibility shims expose legacy tool aliases

See the [migration guide](../migration/flat-to-single-tool.md) for details on transitioning from flat-tool designs.

## Guardrails implied by this matrix

- Keep support language at the domain/action level.
- Keep runtime discovery, README wording, and release-readiness text aligned with the registry-backed scope map.
- Treat `sensitive-read` as a support-boundary class, not as an implementation footnote.
- Do not upgrade deferred discovery visibility into executable support claims.

The release-level summary for these scope decisions is published in [`docs/release/production-readiness.md`](../release/production-readiness.md).

> **Note on classification distinctions:** The PRD Domain Coverage Matrix rows above classify the *listed capability area* (the operations named in the row). The Truth Table below and Summary Counts provide the *overall capability-class view* for each PRD domain, accounting for denied or deferred subsets that exist elsewhere in the domain. For example, `system observability` lists supported diagnostic operations above, while the Truth Table marks it `partially supported` because debug endpoints are denied within that domain. Both views are correct: the row reflects the supported surface; the summary accounts for the full domain boundary.

### PRD domain state summary

| State | Count | Domains |
|---|---|---|
| Fully supported | 16 | users, nodes, hosts, config profiles, internal squads, external squads, subscription settings, subscription templates, subscription page configs, snippets, metadata, bandwidth stats, infra billing, hwid, subscription request history, keygen |
| Partially supported | 1 | system observability |
| Dropped | 2 | connections, node plugins |
| Denied | 0 | N/A |

### Explicit exclusions from PRD scope

The following PRD-explicit exclusions (section 6.2) are correctly denied:

- Public `/sub/*` mutation or management flows remain excluded; the three published `public_subscriptions` read operations are supported
- Auth/passkeys/token bootstrap flows → `auth.*` denied
- Debug/internal-only actions → `system.debug_srr_matcher`, `node_plugins.execute_plugin_executor`, `connections.*`, `metadata.manage_node` denied
